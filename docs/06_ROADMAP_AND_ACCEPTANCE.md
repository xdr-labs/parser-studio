# 06. Roadmap, Gates and Next Action

## Overall

**Goal:** Independently build a dependable Parser Studio Web application, with portable authoring and evidence-backed Fluentd/Stellar output.

### R0 — Foundation and product definition (THIS INITIAL REQUEST)

- [x] Create xdr-labs/parser-studio repository, private by default because future artifacts may contain sensitive data.
- [x] Persist product outcome, scope, competitor-driven UX, workbench specification, function backlog, version-neutral architecture and ordered roadmap.
- [x] Adopt Engineering System configuration and execution instructions.
- [ ] Reconfirm exact sample-derived parser compatibility contract **after the owner supplies samples**.
- **Done criterion:** published docs in Git, check actual file presence and commit SHA; no claim that parser execution exists.

### R1 — Samples, truth contracts and model (NEXT PRIORITY)

- [ ] Receive representative raw logs and at least one actual parser artifact from owner.
- [ ] Classify artifacts: Fluentd config, Stellar legacy files, Stellar modular JSON or other.
- [ ] Identify syntax, ingestion/header rules, event families, normalization fields, timestamp policies and unsupported features.
- [ ] Define portable IR v0.1 + JSON Schema and golden fixtures; privacy-screen all fixtures before commit.
- [ ] RED tests for correct extraction, type mapping, failures and native-runtime equivalence.
- **Done:** sample-based contract and fixture expectations; unknowns explicitly recorded.

### R2 — Working web workbench / core parsing (P0)

- [ ] Create app skeleton, Workbench panes, sample upload/paste and raw event viewer.
- [ ] Event splitting, format candidates, route variants and field highlighting.
- [ ] Rule builder with regex/JSON/KV/Syslog/CSV support and transformations.
- [ ] Typed normalization mapper to evidence-backed Interflow fields.
- [ ] Live RAW/EXTRACTED/NORMALIZED stage preview with test runner integration.
- **Done:** real sample E2E from paste to normalized preview; affected unit/integration/browser tests green.

### R3 — Native validation, regression and export (P0)

- [ ] Sandboxed pinned Fluentd runner with plugin capability manifest.
- [ ] Fixture suite, per-event diagnostics, error grouping, coverage and before/after diff.
- [ ] Revision storage with deterministic hashes, consistent result export.
- [ ] Fluentd output adapter, actual native-engine test, honest compatibility labels.
- [ ] Implement Stellar-specific export only for formats grounded by sample artifacts and real target evidence.
- **Done:** repeatable test report and proven artifact for each supported adapter (no unsupported success).

### R4 — Production-quality usability / supportability (P1)

- [ ] Templates/library, advanced source mode, import error/loss reports and mapping suggestions.
- [ ] Responsive/accessible UI, bilingual labels, security and large dataset behavior.
- [ ] Optional AI assistance under strict opt-in/privacy and deterministic verification.
- [ ] Document packaging, operations, recovery and deployment boundaries.
- **Done:** consistent user journeys, no unsafe feature default, review-ready artifact.

### R5 — User acceptance and release (separate gates)

- [ ] Browser scenario PASS on the actual candidate.
- [ ] Full User E2E by user/operator/admin as applicable, same exact candidate HEAD.
- [ ] Freeze HEAD, qualification/CI/provenance/public smoke as the release contract requires.
- [ ] Owner acceptance; only then release or production deployment with explicit approval.
- **Done:** actual gate evidence, not a narrative assertion.

## Execution order

R0 → R1 → R2 → R3 → R4 → R5. Implement within the current runnable milestone; do not jump to AI helpers/templates ahead of parser correctness. Preserve owner-provided samples and uncommitted work. Follow Engineering System for small deterministic RED→GREEN changes and exact-HEAD evidence.

## Cross-cutting acceptance

- Version-neutral editor can work without a running Stellar instance.
- All samples (including minority variants) yield explained statuses.
- No hidden data loss or unsupported transformations on import/export.
- Exact artifact/version support explicitly backed by runner or target-import evidence.
- Customer data is isolated and not published by default.
- No production effects in the initial development path.

## Concrete NEXT_ACTION

**Await owner sample log(s) and existing parser(s) as the only missing product-specific input; then immediately begin R1 characterization, IR/fixture contract and RED tests.** Until samples arrive, implementation may proceed only on independently specified, testable UI scaffolding without asserting Stellar export compatibility. Use this file as the single canonical roadmap and carry precise Git/CI/fixture status into future handoffs.
